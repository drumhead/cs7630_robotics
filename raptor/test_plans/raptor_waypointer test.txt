Test plan for raptor_waypointer

The test for raptor_waypointer shall determine the following.

[x] Group A: Calculating the correct relative theta for a given set waypoint.
[x]  1) That a goal-current pair creates a correct theta.
    --test w/ x!=y

[x] Group B: Handling waypoint expiration and reset correctly.
[x]  1) That a waypoint is inactive after its set time.
[x]  2) That a waypoint is replaced after a call to the waypoint set service.

[x] Group C: Correctly outputting a fuzzified vector set.
[x]   1) That the vector set output by the unit is 8 elements to the side of the target, each element equal to .9 of the next inner.
