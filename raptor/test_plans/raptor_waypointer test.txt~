Test plan for raptor_waypointer

The test for raptor_waypointer shall determine the following.

[] Group A: Calculating the correct relative theta for a given set waypoint.
[]  1) That a goal-current pair creates a correct theta.
    --test w/ x!=y

[] Group B: Handling waypoint expiration and reset correctly.
[]  1) That a waypoint is inactive after its set time.
[]  2) That a waypoint is replaced after a call to the waypoint set service.

[] Group C: Correctly outputting a fuzzified vector set.
[]   1) That the vector set output by the unit is 8 elements to the side of the target, each element equal to .9 of the next inner.
